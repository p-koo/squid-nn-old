## SQUID Repository
This repository contains the software implementation for our [paper](https://www.google.com) **Title** (Seitz, Kinney* and Koo*). It contains tools to apply the discussed method **SQUID** (**S**urrogate **Qu**antitative **I**nterpretability for **D**eepnets) on genomic models. This work was developed in the Kinney and Koo research groups at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

## Installation:
Currently, SQUID is available to download from PyPI.
`pip install squid`

Alternatively, the required packages can be installed via Anaconda.
`conda create -n squid python=3`
`pip install mavenn`
`pip install mavenn --upgrade`


### Usage:
The `run_squid.py` script contains code for running SQUID on several example deep-learning models.
